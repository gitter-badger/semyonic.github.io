Hello ! This is my first post on my personal blog. I'll try to keep it
updated. In these days I'm toying around with Unreal Engine 4.10. Created two repositories. One is focused on C++ programming other is visual programming with Unreal Blueprints.

Created this site by using Jekyll with a theme template.:
Below snippet is just for testing functionality.

{% highlight java %}
public print_f(name) {
  System.out.println(%s,name)
}
print_f("Semih")
{% endhighlight %}
